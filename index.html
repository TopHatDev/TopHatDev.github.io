        <p>I'm Alec Conner Johnson, I was born in 2007.  I like to Code which is why I made this website in fact.  
          I don't have many close friends I know a lot of people that i'm not to close too but there are those few.  
          I usually like someone but they never had liked me back so far.  
          I enjoy hangingout with people but don't be too social, I don't like dealing with the dramma.  I enjoy Meme and vines or funny videos
